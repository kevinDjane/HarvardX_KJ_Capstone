# HarvardX Capstone Project

This is a repository of the 2 capstone projects for the [final course](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/data-science-capstone?delta=3), of a nine-course series of the [Data Science Professional Certificate by Harvard](https://pll.harvard.edu/series/professional-certificate-data-science).

The first capstone project is a **Movie Recommender System**, and we use simples models to try to predict the rating of movies, we used the RMSE (Root Mean Squeared Error) to evaluate the models.
The second capstone project is a **Income Level Prediction**, we use three models (SVM, Decision Tree and Random Forest) and four metrics (Accuracy, F1 Score, Sensitivity and Specificity) to evaluate our models.
